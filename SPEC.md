# Project Plan

## Overview

Optimize the Semantic Scholar MCP server to reduce API calls, decrease response sizes, and improve reliability. The main issue is that `get_author_top_papers` incorrectly assumes the API doesn't support server-side sorting, leading to excessive API calls (up to 10,000 papers fetched) and large responses (~10.8k tokens). The API actually supports `sort=citationCount:desc`, which eliminates this problem.

## Notes

**Linting:**
```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

**Type checking:**
```bash
uv run ty check

uv run pytest tests/
```

**Run:**
```bash
uv run semantic-scholar-mcp
```

## Implementation Order

Tasks are ordered by priority:

1. **US-1** (P0 Critical): API sorting - biggest impact on rate limits and response size
2. **US-2** (P1 High): API key whitespace - quick fix, prevents configuration bugs
3. **US-3** (P1 High): Compact fields - reduces response size by 30-40%
4. **US-4** (P2 Medium): Configurable limits - nice to have after core optimizations
5. **US-5** (P3 Low): Response size logging - debugging aid

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| API calls (top 5 papers) | 2-11 | 2 |
| Response size (top papers) | 50-500KB | ~5KB |
| Token usage per query | ~10k | ~1-2k |
| Rate limit errors | Frequent | Rare |
