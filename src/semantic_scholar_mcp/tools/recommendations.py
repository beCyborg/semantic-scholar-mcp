    """Find papers similar to a given paper using ML-based recommendations.

    Use this tool to discover related work that you might have missed. The
    Semantic Scholar recommendation system uses machine learning to find papers
    that are semantically similar to the input paper based on content, citations,
    and other signals.

    Args:
        paper_id: The paper identifier. Can be:
            - Semantic Scholar ID (e.g., "649def34f8be52c8b66281af98ae884c09aef38b")
            - DOI with prefix (e.g., "DOI:10.18653/v1/N18-3011")
            - ArXiv ID with prefix (e.g., "ARXIV:2106.15928")
        limit: Maximum number of recommended papers to return (default 10).
        from_pool: The pool of papers to recommend from:
            - "recent": Recently published papers (default). Good for finding
              the latest related work. If no results are found (common for
              older seed papers), automatically falls back to "all-cs".
            - "all-cs": All Computer Science papers. Good for comprehensive
              literature coverage.

    Returns:
        List of recommended papers ranked by similarity, each containing:
        - paperId: Unique Semantic Scholar ID
        - title: Paper title
        - abstract: Paper abstract (if available)
        - year: Publication year
        - citationCount: Number of citations
        - authors: List of authors with names and IDs
        - venue: Publication venue (journal, conference)
        - openAccessPdf: Link to open access PDF (if available)
        - fieldsOfStudy: Research fields the paper belongs to

        Returns an informative message if no recommendations are available
        or the paper is not found.

        >>> get_recommendations("649def34f8be52c8b66281af98ae884c09aef38b")

    """Find papers related to multiple example papers using ML recommendations.

    Use this tool to refine your literature search by providing multiple papers
    as positive examples (papers you want more like) and optionally negative
    examples (papers you want to avoid). The Semantic Scholar recommendation
    system uses machine learning to find papers that are similar to the positive
    examples and dissimilar to the negative examples.

    This is particularly useful when you have identified a few relevant papers
    and want to find more work in the same area, while excluding certain
    tangential topics.
